## Corner Rowhouse

I am live nearby to the proposed development for <INSERT DP NUMBER> and I am writing in support of this development.

The built form is low residential and is consistent with existing developments in the neighborhood on similar plots of land. This style of design has be the standard for corner lots in the area for nearly 10 years now. The height and massing of the design is only a marginal increase over the surrounding structures meaning there should be low impact in regards to shadowing.

On access the proposed design provides ample parking on the lot itself, in addition I regularly walk this street and there is always ample street parking for visitors whenever I pass this location. On top of vehicle access this location is close alternative transport routes like cycle infrastructure on 26th Avenue, 37 Street, 19th Avenue and 17th Avenue as well as close access to the Calgary C-train at Westbrook and two Bus Rapid Transit lines on 37st(teal) and Crowchild(yellow). Access does not get much better than that!

The proposed Landscaping and site layout is reasonable for area and should help grow and preserve existing environmental features in the neighborhood and sets aside reasonable space for garbage and recycling that are requred.

On impact this development will be a huge win for our community. It will help keep our neighborhoods schools enrollment up and it will grow the potential customer base for many of the well loved small businesses in the area

In closing, nothing in this proposal is new or out of place for this area. The development will have multiple benefits on multiple fronts with few downsides. This proposal should be approved and further more these types of low residential development should be approved by default just like a single family home. 

Thanks
