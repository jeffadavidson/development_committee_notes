# Land Use Change Support Template

## Corner To RC-G

I am a resident of Killarney/Glengarry and I am writing in support of this Land Use Change. I actively watch all development in the Killarney/Glengarry area and hope to foster a more walkable, financially stable, equitable neighborhood. The proposed land use change helps us achieve this. The proposed land use change also matches the characteristics of many land use changes to R-CG that have already been approved in the community.

Height/Shadowing - The current direct control zoning has a 10 meters building height limit. The proposed R-CG will bring that to 11.0 meters. In my opinion this is not a vast difference, will not cause any large impact on shadowing or views over what is already allowed

Density - This proposal will allow for the building of marginally more dense buildings. This is essential to the Killarney/Glengarry area that is only just at the same population as it was in the 1970s. If we want our businesses and schools to remain healthy and prosperous we need to allow more people to live here.

Amount of Parking - I regularly walk this area and the road parking is never full. Usually more than 50% of street parking is free. As well the proposed R-CG zoning has minimum parking requirements that already require having storage for cars on the private property. Parking is not an issue for this land use change

Included Amenities - This is a perfect example for gentle density. There is a Bus Rapid Transit walkable distance both east on 37th Street (MAX teal) and West on Crowchild (MAX Yellow), and the site is walkable distance to <Closest Train Station> train station. As well as the transit and bike lanes that run on 26th Ave which is <distance> to the site in question. This resignation may also help bolster enrollment in the local Killarney School, as well as use of or local recreational facility The Killarney Aquatic & Recreation center

Traffic - This area has access to many arterial roads, as well we have access to some of the best transit infrastructure in the city as pointed out in the included amenities section. I have no concerns this proposed land use change will greatly add to the traffic in the area

Community Impact - This Land Use Designation has a clear positive impact on the Killarney/Glengarry neighborhood. This area has become very popular and with the current country wide housing crises prices in the area have risen to a point where all but a fortunate few are excluded from living in the area. Allowing for land uses that allow for more density is critical to having a more varied socioeconomic distribution that will allow people from all walks of life to live here. This is good for our businesses, schools and other infrastructure investments from the city

This land use change is a clear and positive addition to the neighborhood. It would be silly to not approve it. Its silly that it has to go to council at all, it should be an administrative decision.
