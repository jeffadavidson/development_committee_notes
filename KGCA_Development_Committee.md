* Corner lot. Proposal for new rowhouse building

**Personal Suggestion** - It fits the standard of corner lots being redeveloped into row houses, zoning has already been approved. I support it and have already voiced my approval for it

**NOTES**

* Conflict of interest for me as I live within 50 meters
* Support sent via email

* Rezoning of old post office to MU-1
* Wants to use for medical suites - https://postalprojects.ca/

**Personal Suggestion** - I support LOC2021-0136 for the rezoning of 2801 24A ST SW and 2805 24A to MU-1 designation
  * This site is a good choice for upzoning for the following reasons:
  * This site is tens of meters from a BRT MAX line, has good public transportation
  * The site is along a major corridor that already has tentative planning for upzoning in the Westbrook LAP
  * The planned zoning reflects existing buildings to the south and east of the site, this will bring this site in line with its neighbors
  * This site is a near the Viscount Bennett which is being targeted for future densification and development

**NOTES**
  * I submitted a comment of support to the file manager "jarred.friedman@calgary.ca" on 2022-03-22
  * Public hearing 2022-03-29

* Rezoning of a end of the street corner lot from DC to DC/R-CG
* Plans to build an 11 unit 2 building complex
* Comments close - 2022-04-15

**Personal Suggestion** - I support
  * Lot is large
  * it matches the standard for previous upzoning (end of street, large log)
  * it is on a more major street (Richmond Road)
  * it is in between 2 BRT MAX routes

**NOTES**
  * I submitted a comment of support on DMAP on 2022-03-22

## Past Proposals

* [DMap](https://dmap.calgary.ca/?find=DP2021-7563)
* Change of Use of existing building - Uhal Rental

**Personal Suggestion** - Im fine with it

### 3535 26 Avenue SW (DP2021-6888 )

* Review Date: 2021-11-24
* [DMap](https://dmap.calgary.ca/?find=DP2021-6888 )
* Change of Use of existing building - Health Care Service

### 2837 34 Street SW (LOC2021-0159)

* Review Date: 2021-11-24
* [DMap](https://dmap.calgary.ca/?find=LOC2021-0159)
* Redesignation from DC to R-CG
* Land use redesignation, no current development plan, but likely row houses

**Personal Suggestion** I think we should probably approve this

### 2804 37 Street SW (DP2021-7660)

* Review Date: 2021-11-24
* [DMap](https://dmap.calgary.ca/?find=DP2021-7660)
* Multi-Residential Development (1 building, 87 units)
* Is on a main streets project
  * 26th and 37th, across from the minimall
  * Right on BRT route

**Personal Suggestion** I think we should probably approve this, its not earth shattering but density is good


### 2804 26 Street SW (No DP Yet)

* Review Date: 2021-11-24
* Proposal for a 4 unit row house complex
* Wants to rezone from R-C2 to R-CG
* Lot has a mature Americian Elm tree on the east side. Is a City owned tree.Should be protected

**Personal Suggestion** Our support should be conditional on the proponent committing to not damaging the elm ( I want to see a barrier built around it during construction)

### 2440 34 ST SW (LOC2021-0167)

* Review Date: November 10th
* [DMap](https://dmap.calgary.ca/?find=LOC2021-0167)
* Wants to rezone from R-C2 to R-CG for rowhouses, no Development Plan yet
* Apple tree on the north west corner of the lot, city owned
* I might have already commented on this, unsure

**Personal Suggestion** Our support should be conditional on the proponent committing to not damaging the apple tree during future construction

### 3604 RICHMOND RD SW (DP2021-5412)

* Review Date: November 10th
* [DMap](https://dmap.calgary.ca/?find=DP2021-5412)
* Development Proposal for 4 town houses
  * likely 4 basement suites too by my guess
* Richmond road corner.
* Land is already R-CG, so no rezoning
* Close to BRT, and kind of cycle access 
* Lot has a adolescent/mature Americian Elm tree on the west side side. Is a City owned tree.Should be protected

**Personal Suggestion** This one is on Richmond road, I think it would be cool if it was up-zoned to MU-1, it would allow the same row houses to be built(I think) but if any of the owners ever wanted to do a shop it would already be allowed
